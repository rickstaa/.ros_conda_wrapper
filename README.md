This wrapper solves some known problems/conflicts you might experience while trying to use ROS Kinetic/Melodic inside a Conda environment
(see [this ROS topic](https://answers.ros.org/question/256886/conflict-anaconda-vs-ros-catking_pkg-not-found/)).

## How to setup

1.  Clone the repository to your user home directory and cd into the `.ros_conda_wrapper` folder.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rickstaa/.ros_conda_wrapper.git
    cd .ros_conda_wrapper
    ```

### Automatic installation

2.  Run the `install.sh` script to install the ROS Conda wrapper.

### Manual installation

For the manual installation instructions see [this issue](https://github.com/rickstaa/.ros_conda_wrapper/issues/14).

## How to uninstall

To uninstall the ROS Conda wrapper run the `uninstall.sh` script before removing the `.ros_conda_wrapper` repository.

## How to use

### ROS Conda wrapper commands

All of the original `conda` commands work as expected. Additionally, a `--ros-wrapper`
command has been added. This command takes the following options:

-   `activate`: Activates the ROS Conda wrapper.
-   `deactivate`: Deactivates the ROS Conda wrapper.
-   `init <CONDA_ENVIRONMENT>`: Initializes a given Conda environment to work with ROS.
-   `deinit <CONDA_ENVIRONMENT>`: Deinitializes a given ROS Conda environment to work.
-   `-h, --help`: Displays usage information.
-   `-v, --version`: ROS Conda wrapper version.
-   `-s, --show-settings`: Shows the current settings.

:information_source: The `conda --ros-wrapper init` command does not create the environment itself. It only performs some actions such that ROS will work inside a python 3 Conda environment.

### Examples

#### Make conda environment ROS compatible

The following commands can be used to make a Conda environment ROS compatible:

```bash
conda create -n example_env python==3.6
conda --ros-wrapper activate
conda --ros-wrapper init example_env
conda activate example_env
```

Please note that this command installs the bare minimum of packages required to run ROS inside a Conda environment. If you need additional ROS packages, you can install them using the regular `conda install <PACKAGE_NAME>` command. Check the [Conda package repository](https://anaconda.org/search?q=conda-forge) to see if they are available for CONDA.

#### Transform a ROS Conda Wrapper environment back to a typical Conda environment

The following commands can be used to transform a ROS Conda Wrapper environment back to a normal Conda environment:

```bash
conda --ros-wrapper deinit example_env
conda --ros-wrapper deactivate
```

### ROS Conda wrapper environment variables

The ROS Conda wrapper adds the following environment variables:

-   `ROS_CONDA_WRAPPER`: Specifies whether the ROS Conda wrapper is installed.
-   `ROS_CONDA_WRAPPER_ACTIVE`: Specifies whether the ROS Conda wrapper is activated.
-   `ROS_CONDA_WRAPPER_ERROR`: Anaconda is not initiated or installed.

## How it works

The `.conda_wrapper` script creates an alias which wraps the original `activate` and `deactivate` Conda executable arguments. Following this wrapper modifies the `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` such that the right python binaries are used. Additionally, the `conda rosinit <NAME_OF_YOUR_ENVIRONMENT>` command can be used to set up an environment in such a way that ROS works inside the environment. This is done by installing some additional python packages ROS needs (see [this blog post](https://medium.com/@wolfv/ros-on-conda-forge-dca6827ac4b6) by [@wolfv](https://github.com/wolfv)).

## Python compatibility notes

### ROS Noetic

[ROS Noetic](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic) was build for python3 and therefore does not support python2 packages.

### ROS melodic

[ROS Melodic](https://wiki.ros.org/melodic) was build for python2 and therefore in the past did not support python3. Currently all the main ROS Melodic packages have been ported to support python3. You might however still encounter third-party packages which do not support python3.

### ROS Kinetic

[ROS kinetic](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic) does not support python3. Further, there are no plans to port the ROS kinetic python2 packages too python3 ([see ROS REP 3](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html)).
